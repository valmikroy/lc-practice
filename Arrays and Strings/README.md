# Array and Strings notes



- Array delete at 

  ```ruby
  a.delete_at(index) 
  ```

- Try to use `while` loop efficiently with condition.

- loop in loop like following has O(n^2) complexity 

  ```ruby
  idx
  while ( idx loop) do
  	j = idx
  	while( j loop) do
  		
  	end
  end
  ```

- Has element.
