Given a singly linked list L: L0→L1→…→Ln-1→Ln,
reorder it to: L0→Ln→L1→Ln-1→L2→Ln-2→…

You may not modify the values in the list's nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.

Example 1:

Given 1->2->3->4, reorder it to 1->4->2->3.
Example 2:

Given 1->2->3->4->5, reorder it to 1->5->2->4->3.

double linked list
with index and forward and backward pointer 



I am going to table this problem for now 
- we need to write new method which insert in front 
- we have to figure out end confition when we should start itrating 
- we have to build and index in the node
